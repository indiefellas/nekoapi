# @indiefellas/nekoweb-api
A simple typescript wrapper for [Nekoweb's API](https://nekoweb.org/api),
This package also serves as a dependency for our build scripts.

## Building and publishing (dev)
Note: if you're using this library, you don't need this. Just install it and you're done.
To use this library, you need to compile the files using `tsc`.
That is just simple as running `bun compile`.

This project was created on bun v1.2.7. We are by no means associated with Nekoweb.
(p.s. todo: make the readme more complete)
